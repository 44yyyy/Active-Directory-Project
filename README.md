# Active Directory Project - John Yang

## Objective

This project involved building and deploying a security monitoring and response environment for Active Directory user account management. The project begins with network and infrastructure planning and is followed by deploying virtual machines in the cloud, configuring firewall rules, and establishing a Windows Active Directory domain with custom users and permissions. Logs from endpoints were forwarded to a Splunk instance, where they would go through an alert I configured to identify unauthorized login activity. To extend the workflow, I integrated Slack and Shuffle (SOAR) to build an automated response pipeline that alerts a team of analysts and allow them to disable compromised accounts directly through user prompts. This project reinforced my practical understanding of cloud infrastructure, identity management, log ingestion, SIEM tuning, and real-time security automation, essential domains for modern security operations.

### Skills Learned

- Developed cloud infrastructure skills by deploying secure virtual environments and configuring access controls.
- Experience with Active Directory configuration and domain-based identity management.
- Improved capabilities in log ingestion, parsing, and alert tuning within a SIEM.
- Integration of collaboration/communication platforms into incident response workflows through SOAR applications.
- Applied threat detection and response concepts in a simulated SOC environment.

### Tools Used

- Vultr (Cloud Hosting) for deploying virtual machines and simulating a production environment.
- Windows Server & Active Directory for domain services, identity management, and user authentication.
- Splunk (SIEM) for collecting, indexing, and analyzing security logs from endpoint systems.
- Shuffle (SOAR) for building automated incident response workflows.
- Slack for real-time notifications.
- Webhooks & APIs for integrating alerting and response actions across platforms.
